# Team Builder

Deploy a 7-agent SaaS growth team on OpenClaw in one shot.

## System Impact & Prerequisites

> **Read before running.** This skill creates files and modifies system config.

### What it creates
- A new workspace directory with ~40 files (agent configs, shared knowledge, inboxes, kanban)
- `apply-config.js` -- script that **modifies `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`** (adds agents, bindings, agentToAgent config). Auto-backs up before writing.
- `create-crons.ps1` / `create-crons.sh` -- scripts that **create cron jobs** via `openclaw cron add`
- After running these scripts you must **restart the gateway** (`openclaw gateway restart`)

### What it does NOT do automatically
- Does not modify openclaw.json directly -- you run `apply-config.js` yourself
- Does not create cron jobs directly -- you run the cron script yourself
- Does not restart the gateway -- you do that manually

### Optional: Telegram
- If you provide bot tokens during setup, `apply-config.js` will also add Telegram account configs and bindings
- Requires: Telegram bot tokens from @BotFather, your Telegram user ID
- Requires: network access to Telegram API (proxy configurable)

### Optional: ACP / Claude Code
- The fullstack-dev agent is configured to spawn Claude Code via ACP for complex coding tasks
- Requires: ACP-compatible coding agent configured in your OpenClaw environment
- No extra setup needed if you don't use this feature

### Credentials involved
- **Telegram bot tokens** (optional) -- stored in openclaw.json, used for agent-to-Telegram binding
- **Model API keys** -- must already be configured in your OpenClaw model providers (not handled by this skill)

### Recommended
- Review generated `apply-config.js` before running
- Check the backup of openclaw.json after running
- Test with 2-3 agents before enabling all cron jobs

## Team Architecture

Default 7-agent SaaS growth team (customizable to 2-10 agents):

```
CEO
 |-- Chief of Staff (dispatch + strategy + efficiency)
 |-- Data Analyst (data + user research)
 |-- Growth Lead (GEO + SEO + community + social media)
 |-- Content Chief (strategy + writing + copywriting + i18n)
 |-- Intel Analyst (competitor monitoring + market trends)
 |-- Product Lead (product management + tech architecture)
 |-- Fullstack Dev (full-stack dev + ops, spawns Claude Code with role-based prompts)
```

### Multi-Team Support

One OpenClaw instance can run multiple teams:

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/deploy.js                  # default team
node <skill-dir>/scripts/deploy.js --team alpha      # named team "alpha"
node <skill-dir>/scripts/deploy.js --team beta       # named team "beta"
```

Named teams use prefixed agent IDs (`alpha-chief-of-staff`, `beta-growth-lead`) to avoid conflicts. Each team gets its own workspace subdirectory.

### Flexible Team Size

The wizard lets you select 2-10 agents from the available roles. Skip roles you don't need. The 7-agent default covers most SaaS scenarios, but you can run leaner (3-4 agents) or expand with custom roles.

### Model Auto-Detection

The wizard scans your `openclaw.json` for registered model providers and auto-suggests models by role type:

| Role Type | Best For | Auto-detect Pattern |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Thinking | Strategic roles (chief, growth, content, product) | /glm-5\|opus\|o1\|deepthink/i |
| Execution | Operational roles (data, intel, fullstack) | /glm-4\|sonnet\|gpt-4/i |
| Fast | Lightweight tasks | /flash\|haiku\|mini/i |

You can always override with manual model IDs.

## Deployment Flow

### Step 1: Collect Configuration

Ask the user for these inputs (use defaults if not provided):

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Team name | Alpha Team | Used in all docs and configs |
| Workspace dir | `~/.openclaw/workspace-team` | Shared workspace root |
| Timezone | Asia/Shanghai | For cron schedules |
| Morning brief hour | 8 | Chief's morning report |
| Evening brief hour | 18 | Chief's evening report |
| Thinking model | zai/glm-5 | For strategic roles |
| Execution model | zai/glm-4.7 | For execution roles |
| CEO title | Boss | How agents address the CEO |

Optional: Telegram user ID, proxy, and 7 bot tokens.

### Step 2: Run Deploy Script

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/deploy.js
```

Interactive -- asks all questions from Step 1, generates the full workspace.

### Step 3: Apply Config

```bash
node <workspace-dir>/apply-config.js
```

Adds agents to openclaw.json, preserving existing config.

### Step 4: Create Cron Jobs

```bash
# Windows
powershell <workspace-dir>/create-crons.ps1

# Linux/Mac
bash <workspace-dir>/create-crons.sh
```

### Step 5: Restart Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Step 6: Fill Business Info

User must edit:
- `shared/decisions/active.md` -- strategy, priorities
- `shared/products/_index.md` -- products, keywords, competitors (include code directory paths!)
- `shared/knowledge/competitor-map.md` -- competitor analysis
- `shared/knowledge/tech-standards.md` -- coding standards

### Step 7: Trigger Deep Dive Scans

After filling in products with code directories, tell product-lead to trigger Deep Dive scans:
1. Product-lead sends scan requests to fullstack-dev via inbox
2. Fullstack-dev enters each project directory and generates knowledge files
3. Product-lead reviews the generated files for completeness
4. All agents now have deep project understanding for informed decisions

## Cron Schedule

| Offset | Agent | Task | Frequency |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|
| H-1 | Data Analyst | Data + user feedback | Daily |
| H-1 | Intel Analyst | Competitor scan | Mon/Wed/Fri |
| H | Chief of Staff | Morning brief (announced) | Daily |
| H+1 | Growth Lead | GEO + SEO + community | Daily |
| H+1 | Content Chief | Weekly content plan | Monday |
| H+10 | Chief of Staff | Evening brief (announced) | Daily |

(H = morning brief hour)

```



## Knowledge Governance

Each shared knowledge file has a designated owner. Only the owner agent updates it; others read only.

| File | Owner | Update Trigger |
|------|-------|---------------|
| geo-playbook.md | growth-lead | After GEO experiments/discoveries |
| seo-playbook.md | growth-lead | After SEO experiments |
| competitor-map.md | intel-analyst | After each competitor scan |
| content-guidelines.md | content-chief | After proven writing patterns |
| user-personas.md | data-analyst | After new user insights |
| tech-standards.md | product-lead | After architecture decisions |

### Update Protocol
When updating a knowledge file, the owner must:
1. Add a dated entry at the top: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <what changed>`
2. Include the reason and data evidence
3. Never delete existing entries without CEO approval (append, don't replace)

### Chief of Staff Governance
The chief-of-staff monitors knowledge file health during weekly reviews:
- Are files being updated regularly?
- Any conflicting information between files?
- Any stale entries that should be archived?

## Self-Evolution Pattern

Agents improve their own strategies over time through a feedback loop:

```
1. Execute task (cron or inbox triggered)
2. Collect results (data, metrics, outcomes)
3. Analyze: what worked vs what didn't
4. Update knowledge files with proven strategies (with evidence)
5. Next execution reads updated knowledge → better performance
```

This is NOT the agent randomly changing rules. Updates must be:
- **Data-driven**: backed by metrics or concrete outcomes
- **Incremental**: append new findings, don't rewrite everything
- **Traceable**: dated with evidence so others can verify

### What Agents Can Self-Update
- Their own knowledge files (per ownership table above)
- Their own MEMORY.md (lessons learned, decisions)
- shared/data/ outputs (data-analyst only)

### What Requires CEO Approval
- shared/decisions/active.md (strategy changes)
- Adding/removing agents or changing team architecture
- External publishing or spending decisions

## Public Data Layer

The `shared/data/` directory serves as a read-only data pool for all agents:

- **data-analyst** writes: daily metrics, user feedback summaries, anomaly alerts
- **All agents** read: to inform their own decisions
- Format: structured markdown or JSON, dated filenames (e.g., `metrics-2026-03-01.md`)
- Retention: keep 30 days, archive older files

## Project Deep Dive — Code Scanning

Agents can deeply understand each SaaS product through automated code scanning. This is critical — without deep project knowledge, all team decisions are surface-level.

### How It Works

1. CEO adds a product to `shared/products/_index.md` (name, URL, code directory, tech stack)
2. Product Lead triggers a Deep Dive scan by messaging Fullstack Dev via inbox
3. Fullstack Dev enters the project directory (read-only) and scans the codebase
4. Knowledge files are generated in `shared/products/{product}/`
5. All agents read these files before making product-related decisions

### Product Knowledge Directory

Each product gets a knowledge directory with up to 20 files:

```
shared/products/{product}/
├── overview.md          ← Product positioning (from _index.md)
├── architecture.md      ← System architecture, tech stack, design patterns, layering
├── database.md          ← Full table schema, relationships, indexes, migrations
├── api.md               ← API endpoints, params, auth, versioning
├── routes.md            ← Complete route table (Web + API + Console)
├── models.md            ← ORM relationships, scopes, accessors, observers
├── services.md          ← Business logic, state machines, workflows, validation
├── frontend.md          ← Component tree, page routing, state management
├── auth.md              ← Auth scheme, roles/permissions matrix, OAuth
├── integrations.md      ← Third-party: payment/email/SMS/storage/CDN/analytics
├── jobs-events.md       ← Queue jobs, event listeners, scheduled tasks, notifications
├── config-env.md        ← Environment variables, feature flags, cache strategy
├── dependencies.md      ← Key dependencies, custom packages, vulnerabilities
├── devops.md            ← Deployment, CI/CD, Docker, monitoring, logging
├── test-coverage.md     ← Test strategy, coverage, weak spots
├── tech-debt.md         ← TODO/FIXME/HACK inventory, dead code, complexity hotspots
├── domain-flows.md      ← Core user journeys, domain boundaries, module coupling
├── data-flow.md         ← Data lifecycle: external → import → process → store → output
├── i18n.md              ← Internationalization, language coverage
├── changelog.md         ← Scan diff log (what changed between scans)
└── notes.md             ← Agent discoveries, gotchas, implicit rules
```

### Scan Levels

| Level | Scope | When | Output |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| L0 Snapshot | Surface: directory tree, packages, env | First onboard | architecture, dependencies, config-env |
| L1 Skeleton | Structure: DB, routes, models, components | First onboard | database, routes, api, models, frontend |
| L2 Deep Dive | Logic: services, auth, jobs, integrations | On-demand per module | services, auth, jobs-events, integrations, domain-flows, data-flow |
| L3 Health Check | Quality: tech debt, tests, security | Periodic / pre-release | tech-debt, test-coverage, devops |
| L4 Incremental | Delta: git diff → update affected files | After code changes | changelog + targeted updates |

### Content Standards

Knowledge files capture not just WHAT exists but WHY:
- **Design decisions**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Implicit business rules**: Logic buried in code (e.g., "orders auto-cancel after 72h")
- **Gotchas**: What breaks if you touch this module carelessly
- **Cross-module coupling**: Where changing A silently breaks B
- **Performance hotspots**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, bottleneck endpoints

### Role Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Product Lead | **Governance**: trigger scans, review quality, track freshness, ensure completeness |
| Fullstack Dev | **Execution**: enter code directory, scan, generate/update knowledge files |
| All Agents | **Consumption**: read product knowledge before any product-related decision |

### Per-Stack Auto-Detection

Fullstack Dev auto-detects tech stack and applies stack-specific scan strategies:
- **Laravel/PHP**: migrations, route:list, Models, Services, Middleware, Policies, Jobs, Console/Kernel
- **React/Vue**: components, router, stores, API client, i18n
- **Python/Django/FastAPI**: models.py, urls.py, views.py, middleware, celery
- **General**: tree, git log, grep TODO/FIXME, .env.example, Docker, CI, tests

## Team Coordination v2

### Inbox Protocol v2 (status tracking)

Every inbox message now has a `status` field:
- `pending` → `received` → `in-progress` → `done` (or `blocked`)
- Chief-of-staff monitors timeouts: high>4h, normal>24h pending = intervention
- Blocked >8h = escalation to CEO
- Recipients MUST update status immediately upon reading

### Team Dashboard (`shared/status/team-dashboard.md`)

Chief-of-staff maintains a "live scoreboard" updated every session:
- 🔴 Urgent/Blocked items
- 📊 Per-agent status table (last active, current task, status icon)
- 📬 Unprocessed inbox summary (pending/blocked messages across all inboxes)
- 🔗 Cross-agent task chain tracking (A→B→C with per-step status)
- 📅 Today/Tomorrow focus

**All agents read this file first when waking up.** 5-second situational awareness.

### Chief-of-Staff as Router

The chief is upgraded from "briefing writer" to "active team router":
- **Blocker detection**: scans all inboxes for overdue messages
- **Active dispatch**: writes reminders directly to lagging agents' inboxes
- **Task chain tracking**: identifies multi-agent workflows and tracks each step
- **Escalation**: persistent blockers get flagged to CEO
- **Runs 4x/day** (morning brief, midday patrol, afternoon patrol, evening brief)

### Cron Schedule (10 jobs, up from 7)

| Time | Agent | Type | Purpose |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| 07:00 | data-analyst | daily | Data pull + feedback scan |
| 08:00 | chief-of-staff | **announce** | Morning: router scan + brief + quality |
| 09:00 | growth-lead | daily | GEO/SEO/community |
| 09:00 | product-lead | **daily (NEW)** | Inbox + knowledge governance + task delegation |
| 10:00 | content-chief | **daily M-F (was weekly)** | Content creation + collaboration |
| 10:00 | fullstack-dev | **daily (enhanced)** | Inbox + Deep Dive + dev tasks + patrol |
| 12:00 | chief-of-staff | **patrol (NEW)** | Router scan only, no brief |
| 15:00 | chief-of-staff | **patrol (NEW)** | Router scan only, no brief |
| 18:00 | chief-of-staff | **announce** | Evening: router scan + summary + next day plan |
| 07:00 M/W/F | intel-analyst | 3x/week | Competitor scan |

### Why These Changes Matter

| Before | After | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Inbox = blind drop | Inbox with status tracking | Messages are acknowledged and trackable |
| Chief 2x/day | Chief 4x/day with router role | Blockers caught within hours, not days |
| Content-chief 1x/week | Daily M-F | Actually produces content |
| Product-lead no cron | Daily | Knowledge governance happens |
| No team dashboard | Dashboard every session | All agents know the full picture |
| No timeout detection | Automatic timeout rules | Nothing falls through cracks |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Shared workspace** so qmd indexes everything for all agents
- **Inbox Protocol v2** with status tracking and timeout rules for reliable async communication
- **Chief as Router** — not just a briefing writer but active coordinator who detects and resolves blockers
- **Team Dashboard** — single source of truth for team-wide status, maintained by chief every session
- **GEO as #1 priority** (AI search = blue ocean)
- **Fullstack Dev spawns Claude Code** via ACP for complex tasks
- **Project Deep Dive** gives all agents deep codebase understanding, not just surface-level product overviews

## Customization

Edit ROLES array in `scripts/deploy.js` to add/remove agents.
Edit `references/soul-templates.md` for SOUL.md templates.
Edit `references/shared-templates.md` for shared file templates.
